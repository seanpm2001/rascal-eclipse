# rascal-eclipse

Eclipse IMP based IDE for the Rascal meta-programming language, including IDE plugin generator for domain-specific languages.

> **Warning**
> The rascal-eclipse project has served the community for many years, but now it appears our users gravitate to the VScode extension,
> and the VScode extension generators based on the language server protocol. This means that as of Feb 1st, 2023, the current project
> is marked *deprecated*, and users are advised to move to the rascal-language-server support in VScode. Only small bugfix releases will
> be planned for the coming year to support users who do not have time to switch over yet.
