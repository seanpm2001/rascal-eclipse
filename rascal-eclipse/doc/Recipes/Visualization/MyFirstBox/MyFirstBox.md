#### Examples

Drawing a red [box]((Library:Figure-box)) is as simple as this:
```rascal-figure,width=,height=,file=b1.png
import vis::Figure;
import vis::Render;
b = box(fillColor("red"));
render(b);
```
and it will look like this:

![]((b1.png))
 or rather, it will look like this:



![]((MyFirstBox-Screenshot1.png))


Wow, the box fills the whole window! So lets give our box a [size]((Library:Properties-size)):
```rascal-figure,width=,height=,file=b2.png
import vis::Figure;
import vis::Render;
b = box(fillColor("red"), size(200,100));
render(b);
```
and it will look like this:

![]((b2.png))


On screen however, it still fills the whole window as shown above.
The lesson here is that size is to be taken as *minimum size* (and probably we should
rename `size` to `minSize` to emphasize this).

So how can we produce a box that does _not_ fill the whole window? The answer is to define the size of the box
_relative_ to its surroundings by using [shrink]((Library:Properties-shrink)):

```rascal-figure,width=,height=,file=b3.png
import vis::Figure;
import vis::Render;
b = box(fillColor("red"), shrink(0.5));
render(b);
```
which says: _I am a red box and I want to occupy 50% of the available space._ The result is:


![]((MyFirstBox-Screenshot2.png))


Shrinking can also be limited to one dimension using [hshrink]((Library:Properties-hshrink)) 
or [vshrink]((Library:Properties-vshrink)):
```rascal-figure,width=,height=,file=b4.png
import vis::Figure;
import vis::Render;
b = box(fillColor("red"), hshrink(0.5));
render(b);
```
which says:_ I am a red box and I want to occupy 50% of the available space in the horizontal direction and 100% of the available space in the vertical direction._ The result is:


![]((MyFirstBox-Screenshot3.png))


Relative sizes can also be used when figures are nested.

```rascal-figure,width=,height=,file=b5.png
import vis::Figure;
import vis::Render;
b1 = box(fillColor("red"), hshrink(0.5));
b2 = box(b1, fillColor("yellow"), size(200,100));
render(b2);
```

![]((b5.png))     


#### Benefits

#### Pitfalls

In the above examples we have consistently added the two imports:
```rascal
import vis::Figure;
import vis::Render;
```
In other recipes and the Rascal documentation we omit these two imports to avoid cluttering our examples with irrelevant details.
Be aware that you will always need them when creating a visualisation.
